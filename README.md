# Devicetree tools

> ðŸš§ NOTE: `dt-tools` is very experimental!

`dt-tools` helps you to write, debug and read Devicetree files more efficiently with advanced tooling!

* [IDE integration](#lsp)
* Linting
* Devicetree binding validation
* Possibly in the future:
  * Comparing DTS or DTB files
  * Comparing Android `dt` and `dtbo` partitions with `/sys/firmware/fdt`

## Crates

* `crates/dt-parser` implements an error-resistant parser inspired by rust-analyzer
* `crates/dt-analyzer` is a source file analyzer
* `crates/dt-lsp` is a [language server](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide#why-language-server) for devicetree
* `crates/dt-lint` is a linter - currently only exposed to the LSP
* `crates/dt-binding-matcher` is a crate supposed to validate and match devicetree binding YAMLs

## Help needed

* `crates/dt-binding-matcher` could use a little help from the contributors of [dt-schema](https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema)
* DTS generator
* Code to gobble up directories of devicetree bindings. Currently hardcoded to search from
  `/home/axel/dev/mainlining/linux/Documentation/devicetree/bindings` and
  `crates/dt-binding-matcher/dt-schema/dtschema`
  * Currently the schemas aren't stored in the binary and are looked up at runtime
  * Add a small cache with a list of matching `compatible` items for simple definitions or whole `select` JSON schemas
    along with the root binding documentation
* VSCode extension to provide the LSP client
* Take care of code containing `TODO`, `FIXME`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!` or similar
* A good and correct way to to get YAML file offsets from JSON Schema
  * The easiest way would be with just the [schema path](https://docs.rs/jsonschema/latest/jsonschema/error/struct.ValidationError.html#structfield.schema_path), but I think it could lead to incorrect positions
  * I'll need a YAML parser in Rust that can reverse paths to file offsets to make LSP integration work
* Fork [json-schema-rs](https://github.com/stranger6667/jsonschema-rs) or contribute upstream to add a way to
  1. Add meta-schemas more efficiently than calling `.insert` [a bunch of times](https://docs.rs/jsonschema/latest/src/jsonschema/compilation/options.rs.html#569)
  2. Add spans to error reporting?
  3. Maybe roll out a custom solution so we don't have to fixup everywhere and to support [`phandle: true`](https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/5fdf9654d5069ef0ec430525d98cf3c04086405d/dtschema/schemas/types.yaml#L331)?
  4. Make its error reporting at least output file information (`$id` and `$ref`)

## Testing

`dt-tools` has extensive unit and integration tests, written in Rust. Here's how you can run them!

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. Clone this repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://git.axka.fi/dt-tools.git dt-tools
   cd dt-tools
   ```
3. Run some commands:
   ```sh
   # Showcase parser output
   cargo run --bin test_parser ./crates/dt-parser/a.dts
   cargo run --bin test_parser ./syntax_error_showcase.dts
   # Showcase analyzer output
   cargo run --bin test_analyzer ./syntax_error_showcase.dts
   cargo test # Run unit and integration tests
   ```

### LSP

The language server is currently only packaged for Neovim with the `./crates/dt-lsp/lsp.lua` script. I'd appreciate efforts to make a plugin for VSCode.

```sh
cd ./crates/dt-lsp
nvim -S lsp.lua ../../lint_showcase.dts
```

Features:
* Fast and safe parser and linter
* (TODO) View binding documentation straight from DTS!
* (TODO) Binding errors integrated into linter

## Contributing patches

Please first make sure that you have not introduced any regressions by running `cargo clippy` and `cargo test` at the repository root.

You can either make a GitHub [pull request](https://github.com/axelkar/dt-tools/pulls) or email me directly:

0. Setup `git send-email`:

   <https://git-send-email.io/>

1. Commit your changes, this will open up a text editor

   `git commit`

2. Send your patches to me. The command sends the last commit

   `git send-email --to="axel@axka.fi" HEAD^`
